# Companion for Radio France  

Add easy download and keyboard shortcuts for almost all keys on the Radio France player(s).

The shortcuts are:  
|<kbd>Space</kbd>|Pause and resume|
|--|--|
|:arrow_left:|-10s|
|:arrow_right:|+10s|
|:arrow_up:|Increase volume|
|:arrow_down:|Decrease volume|

Should work for every radio, except "Mouv'" that, for now, has some malfunctionning buttons.
